# Implementation of "A Vectorial Semantics Approach to Personality Assessment" by Neuman et al. (2014)

## VSM - Feature Extraction

Neuman et al. proposed the construction of a set of vectors using a small group of adjectives, which according to theoretical and/or empirical knowledge, encode the essence of personality traits and personality disorders. Using a context-free word embedding they measured the semantic similarity between these vectors and the text written by different individuals. The similarity scores derived, allowed to quantify the degree in which a particular personality trait or disorder was evident in the text.

### Positional arguments

* ```corpus_pp_path```: Preprocessed corpus path. In essence, it is a two-column TSV file,where the first column contains the username and the second one the preprocessed text generated by that user. The first row is the header.
* ```predefined_vectors_path```: Personality traits and Personality Disorders word-vectors.
* ```word_embeddings_path```: Pre-trained word representations (in binary). E.g., [GoogleNews-Vectors](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
